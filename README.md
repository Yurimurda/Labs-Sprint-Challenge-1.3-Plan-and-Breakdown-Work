# Labs-Sprint-Challenge-1.3-Plan-and-Breakdown-Work

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques that you have been applying to your labs project. This week you have been working as a team to first discover the tasks that need to be broken down into smaller units of work. Also, this week you should have been down in the trenches designing, coding or at the very least setting up the architecture for your labs product and data science problem and we want to hear from you about how things are going.

In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate understanding over what you have been working on by responding to 2 prompts and working alone on some User Stories.

**For the User Stories Quiz** you will need to make a new Trello board and link to it in your Journal Entry document.

## Instructions

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Journal Entry.**

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Journal Entry. However, you are encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule and seek support from your TL if you need direction. Your work reflects your proficiency in user interface and your command of the concepts and techniques in team planning and product vision.

We have allocated time on your schedule to ensure that you get this done at the end of each sprint.

- For Full Time Students: Please submit your work on this journal entry before 12pm PST every Friday.
- For Part Time Students: Please submit your work on this journal entry before the end of your 2nd '5th' day.

## Template: Decision Defense

Please respond to the following prompts to demonstrate your understanding of product vision planning sessions.

## Prompt 1

Describe the break down process of your first release. **(Non-UX students only)**

- Include a screenshot of your current Trello board.

- What are the user stories you broke your first release into? Please list them out.

- As a user, I want to sign into the website using google.

- As a user, I want to select the button leading into the customers page.

- As a user, I want to be able to use the search bar to find a specific customer by name, address, or zipcode. 

Describe the design choices behind one of your designs for one flow.. **(UX students only)**
- Include a screenshot of the flow along with the link to your figma.
- Describe the choices that led to this design from both a visual design and usability perspective.

## Prompt 2

Find a Trello card that is assigned to you. **(Non-UX students only)**

- Include a screenshot of the detailed Trello card
[<img src="/prompt2.png" width = "200" />]
- How does this task tie to the overall product vision?

Users will need to be able to find registered customers by reference of
more than one search criteria. The customers found will have links that
are referential to their profiles among other details for the user's 
direct access.

- What steps go into completing this task? How long do you think it will take you to deliver this task?

Implement additional search parameters.

It is already functional to search by name, to add the address and zipcode parameters will take a day tops. 

Describe how you implemented feedback from design critiques. **(UX students only)**
- What feedback did you receive from other teams and your design manager? Talk about one specific piece of feedback in detail.
- Take one of your designs. How did you address the feedback and change the design based on design critiques? Please include screenshots of iterations for this design. 

## User Story Quiz (Non-UX Students Only)

For this quiz we'd like you to spend time writing out User Stories the same way that we did in class together during Sprint 2.
Use the link below:
**[Here is a link to a Balsamiq Wireframe of a few features](https://balsamiq.cloud/stbn0wl/pi0rkk3/r2278).**

- Create a new trello board and make sure you make it public
- Include a Motivation and finish line for each user story
